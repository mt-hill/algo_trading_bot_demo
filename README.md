# BTC Algorithmic Trading Bot App (DEMO)


#### *This repository serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of an algorithmic trading bot I built. Please note that this is not a fully functional trading bot application but rather a simulated version showing the capabilities of an actual trading bot.*

## Description
This trading bot is pretty flexible, it can handle trading on most exchanges with ANY coins listed on the exchange: BTC, ETH, DOGE, PEPE.. whatever. Simple trading strategies or more complex ones, this bot can handle it. Stores multiple trading strategies allowing you to switch between them whenever you need.

Stores all price and trade history allowing you to keep track and monitor whats going on. If you need to stop the bot or tweak its settings, it can be done with buttons or simple text input. No coding knowledge necessary.

Fully automated, meaning you can let it do its thing. Unless you need to manage trading strategies which is easily done.

## **Trading Strategy**

The demo app is replicating real trades based on real BTC price action. It's using a strategy which I have backtested and is profitable as you can see from the profits and wins. The winrate, trades and profits are close to being 100% accurate. For the sake of the demostration, it doesn't take into consideration trading fees and slippage. I wont disclose the trading strategy and have removed the trading logic from the code.

Keep visiting the demo app to see how it performs over time.

## Notes
